Hence, I did some triage on the APISIX repo. I stumbled upon this one question:\\n\\nWe have a requirement to use a plugin, where we need to route the traffic on percentage basis. I\'ll give an example for better understanding.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What is URL\\n\\nWe have an URL https://xyz.com/ca/fr/index.html where ca is country (canada) and fr is french language. Now the traffic needs to routed 10% to https://xyz.com/ca/en/index.html and the remaining 90% to https://xyz.com/ca/fr/index.html. And whenever we\'re routing the traffic to https://xyz.com/ca/en/index.html we need to set a cookie. So for next call, if the cookie is there, it should directly go to https://xyz.com/ca/en/index.html else it should go via a 10:90 traffic split. What is the best possible way to achieve this ??\\n\\n-- help request: Setting cookie based on a condition\\n\\n## Use case\\n\\nThe use case is interesting, and I decided to tackle it.\\n\\nI\'ll rephrase the requirements first:\\n\\nIf no cookie is set, randomly forward the request to one of the upstreams\\nIf a cookie has been set, forward the request to the correct upstream.\\nFor easier testing:\\n\\nSoftware engineering is a field that always changes to keep up with innovation and client needs. As developers, we have a difficult job staying up to date with these swift changes. It is imperative that we approach our information sources selectively because it is so easy for anyone to create a blog and publish anything.\\n\\n## Change of odds\\n\\nI change the odds from 10:90 to 50:50\\nI use the root instead of a host plus a path\\nFinally, I assume that the upstream sets the cookie.\\n\\nNewcomers to Apache APISIX understand the matching algorithm very quickly: if a request matches a route\'s host, method, and path, forward it to the upstream set.\\n\\nEverything you need to know about CSS in blog and guide form.

Product managers and designers write these brief stories to convey why users need or want certain functionality\\n\\nHere are a few tips you might find useful.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nFor software devs, it\'s easy to focus on what you\'re making and forget who you\'re building software for. While the Agile methodology stresses the importance of feature requirements, the end user should be top of mind throughout the entire software development process. Thankfully, you can frame these requirements in a short, simple description. We call these templates a user story.\\n\\n**Creating user** stories helps devs understand the problems they\u2019re solving for users and how to make their tasks easier. With simple, non-technical language, you can establish the value behind a piece of software. Not only will this help teams understand what they\'re making, but also why it matters.\\n\\n## What is a user story?\\n\\n![User Story](https://www.pluralsight.com/content/dam/pluralsight2/siege-blog-assets/user-story-definition.png)\\n\\nA user story describes product features from the end user\u2019s perspective. Product managers and designers write these brief stories to convey why users need or want certain functionality. Within the range of Agile team practices, user stories are the smallest unit of work, so they are intended to be specific.\\n\\n## Three C\'s\\n\\nThree elements go into creating user stories, known as the three C\u2019s:\\n\\n**The card**: This is the physical place where you write a user story. Placing the story on a physical card helps cement for team members the criteria and user problem it\u2019s solving.\\n\\n**The conversation**: User stories inspire team discussions on how to meet the user requirements. Your team can brainstorm new solutions by asking questions and reaching a shared understanding.\\n\\n**The confirmation**: Product managers and designers need to lay out acceptance criteria that meet user requirements. Once your team wants to proceed with a solution, devs move forward with this confirmation.\\n\\n## Standard user story template\\n\\nUser stories consist of one or two sentences. In that space, they describe end users who earn value through your product. The user story format reads: \\"As a [user], I want to [goal] so that [benefit].\\"\\n\\nLet\'s explore that format in more detail:\\n\\n**As a [user]**: Explain who you\'re building this product for. Go beyond job titles and cliches, and capture the user\'s inner sense of value. If your organization uses buyer personas, you can apply a specific one here.\\n\\n**I want to [goal]**: Describe the user\u2019s intentions rather than how they get there. The goal matters more than implementation.\\n\\n**So that [benefit]**: Break down how meeting a goal benefits the user. Remember to look at the bigger picture or a deeper desire in users.\\n\\n## Types of user stories\\n\\nDepending on the complexity of your user stories, they may fit into different categories. Sometimes, you can even combine user stories into a larger narrative. Below are the four main types of user stories:\\n\\n**Simple**: These are individual or self-contained user stories that focus on a particular user or type of product.\\n\\n**Epic**: Groups of related user stories come together to form epics. They may involve multiple users working together or independently or multiple needs for a single type of user to achieve some goal or benefit.\\n\\n**Thematic**: These are major investments and strategies that group epics together. Thematic user stories highlight how a company will achieve wider goals.\\n\\n**Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)**: These user stories add extra details such as a benefit hypothesis, cost of delay, or nonfunctional requirements.\\n\\n![Types of User Stories](https://www.pluralsight.com/content/dam/pluralsight2/siege-blog-assets/user-story-types.png)\\n\\nSimply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.\\n\\nRegular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.\\n\\nThe blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:\\n\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`\\n\\nA blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:\\n\\nThe blog supports tags as well!\\n\\n**And if you don\'t want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config."}]}}')}}]);
