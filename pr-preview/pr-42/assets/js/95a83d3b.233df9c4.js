So how does it manage to handle **thousands of concurrent connections**, **network I/O**, \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e and **file reads/writes**\u2014with just one thread?\\n\\nThe short answer: **It doesn\u2019t.**\\n\\nNode.js uses a **single thread for executing JavaScript**, but it\u2019s backed by a **multi-threaded architecture under the hood** using:\\n\\n- The **libuv thread pool** (4 threads by default)\\n- The **cluster module** (multi-process architecture)\\n- **Worker threads** (for CPU-bound tasks)\\n\\nIn this post, we\u2019ll dive into how Node.js achieves real-world scalability using the `cluster` module\u2014comparing this process-based approach with Java\u2019s traditional multithreading model\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What is the Cluster Module ?\\n\\nThe `cluster` module allows you to **create multiple copies (workers)** of your Node.js application. These workers are separate **processes**, not threads. These are forked from a single **master process**, and they can be scheduled by the OS to run on **different CPU cores**, giving you **true parallelism** \u2014 not just concurrency. The workers have these similarity among them:\\n\\n- Run the **same code**\\n- Share the same **server port**\\n- Can handle requests **independently and in parallel**\\n\\nSo even though each process is still single-threaded internally, together they give the illusion of **multithreaded execution**\u2014because multiple requests can be handled **at the same time** by different processes.\\n\\n### Why use clustering?\\n\\n- To **utilize all CPU cores** on the machine (default Node.js uses only one)\\n- To handle **more concurrent requests** without blocking\\n- To build **scalable** and **high-performance** applications\\n\\n### Understanding Node.js Scaling with the Kitchen Analogy\\n\\nImagine your restaurant has **8 kitchens.**\\n\\n- At first, you have **only 1 chef** working in **just one kitchen**. That chef can only cook one order at a time, so the other 7 kitchens sit empty and unused.\\n- Now, you hire **7 more chefs**, so you have **8 chefs working in 8 separate kitchens**.\\n  Each chef can cook orders independently, so you can serve **8 customers at the same time** \u2014 fully using all your kitchens.\\n\\nHere in this analogy, kitchen refers to the CPU cores and the chefs are the processes to handle different operations.\\n\\nNote:- When you use the **`cluster` module** in Node.js, you\'re not creating _threads_ like you might in Java or C++. Instead, you\'re creating multiple **independent processes.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Practical Example with Code\\n\\n```jsx\\nconst cluster = require(\\"cluster\\");\\nconst os = require(\\"os\\");\\nconst knexConfig = //DB_Connections\\nconst knex = require(\\"knex\\")(knexConfig);\\nconst numCPUs = os.cpus().length;\\n\\nconst mode =\\n  process.argv.find((arg) => arg.startsWith(\\"--mode=\\"))?.split(\\"=\\")[1] ||\\n  \\"cluster\\";\\n\\nasync function processPropertiesSequentially(properties) {\\n  const workerKnex = require(\\"knex\\")(knexConfig);\\n\\n  for (const property of properties) {\\n    await workerKnex(\\"properties\\").where(\\"uuid\\", property.uuid).update({\\n      property_date_type: \\"date-given\\",\\n    });\\n  }\\n\\n  await workerKnex.destroy();\\n}\\n\\nif (mode === \\"single\\") {\\n  console.log(\\"Running in SINGLE-threaded mode\\");\\n  console.time(\\"Single-threaded duration\\");\\n\\n  knex(\\"properties\\")\\n    .select(\\"uuid\\", \\"property_date_type\\")\\n    .where(\\"property_date_type\\", \\"dated\\")\\n    .then(async (properties) => {\\n      await processPropertiesSequentially(properties);\\n      console.timeEnd(\\"Single-threaded duration\\");\\n      await knex.destroy();\\n      process.exit(0);\\n    })\\n    .catch(async (err) => {\\n      console.error(\\"Error fetching properties:\\", err);\\n      await knex.destroy();\\n      process.exit(1);\\n    });\\n} else if (mode === \\"cluster\\") {\\n  if (cluster.isMaster) {\\n    console.log(\\"Running in CLUSTER mode\\");\\n    console.log(`Master ${process.pid} is running`);\\n    console.time(\\"Cluster duration\\");\\n\\n    knex(\\"properties\\")\\n      .select(\\"uuid\\", \\"property_date_type\\")\\n      .where(\\"property_date_type\\", \\"dated\\")\\n      .then((properties) => {\\n        const plainProperties = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(properties));\\n        const chunkSize = Math.ceil(plainProperties.length / numCPUs);\\n        let exitedWorkers = 0;\\n\\n        for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {\\n          const start = i * chunkSize;\\n          const end = start + chunkSize;\\n          const propertyChunk = plainProperties.slice(start, end);\\n\\n          const worker = cluster.fork();\\n          worker.send(propertyChunk);\\n\\n          worker.on(\\"message\\", (msg) => {\\n            console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid}: ${msg}`);\\n          });\\n\\n          worker.on(\\"exit\\", async (code) => {\\n            exitedWorkers++;\\n            if (exitedWorkers === numCPUs) {\\n              console.timeEnd(\\"Cluster duration\\");\\n              await knex.destroy();\\n              process.exit(0);\\n            }\\n          });\\n        }\\n      })\\n      .catch(async (err) => {\\n        console.error(\\"Error fetching properties:\\", err);\\n        await knex.destroy();\\n        process.exit(1);\\n      });\\n  } else {\\n    process.on(\\"message\\", async (propertyChunk) => {\\n      const workerKnex = require(\\"knex\\")(knexConfig);\\n      try {\\n        for (const property of propertyChunk) {\\n          await workerKnex(\\"properties\\").where(\\"uuid\\", property.uuid).update({\\n            property_date_type: \\"date-given\\",\\n          });\\n        }\\n      } catch (err) {\\n        process.send(`Error: ${err.message}`);\\n      } finally {\\n        await workerKnex.destroy();\\n        process.exit(0);\\n      }\\n    });\\n  }\\n} else {\\n  console.error(`Unknown mode: ${mode}`);\\n  process.exit(1);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Pseudo Code\\n\\n```jsx\\n1.

In this guide, we\'ll explore how to implement effective form validation in your fintech applications using React Hook Form and Yup, two powerful tools that make the process straightforward and efficient.\\n\\n## Why Is Form Validation Important in Fintech?\\n\\nFintech applications handle sensitive financial data, making form validation essential for:\\n\\n- **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring users provide correct and complete information.\\n- **Security**: Preventing malicious inputs that could compromise the system.\\n- **Compliance**: Adhering to regulations like KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering).\\n- **User Experience**: Providing immediate feedback to users, reducing errors and frustration.\\n\\n## Introducing React Hook Form and Yup\\n\\n### React Hook Form\\n\\nReact Hook Form is a lightweight library that simplifies form management in React applications. It offers:\\n\\n- **Performance**: Minimizes re-renders, enhancing performance.\\n- **Ease of Use**: Simple API for registering inputs and handling submissions.\\n- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with validation libraries like Yup.\\n\\n### Yup\\n\\nYup is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. It allows developers to define a schema for their data and validate it accordingly.\\n\\n## Setting Up React Hook Form with Yup\\n\\nLet\'s walk through setting up a simple registration form with fields for full name, email, phone number, and password.\\n\\n### 1. Install the Necessary Packages\\n\\nFirst, install React Hook Form, Yup, and the resolver that connects them:\\n\\n```\\nnpm install react-hook-form yup @hookform/resolvers\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Define the Validation Schema with Yup\\n\\nCreate a schema that specifies the validation rules for each field:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport * as Yup from \\"yup\\";\\n\\nconst validationSchema = Yup.object().shape({\\n  fullName: Yup.string()\\n    .required(\\"Full name is required\\")\\n    .min(2, \\"Full name must be at least 2 characters\\"),\\n  email: Yup.string()\\n    .email(\\"Invalid email address\\")\\n    .required(\\"Email is required\\"),\\n  phoneNumber: Yup.string()\\n    .matches(/^[0-9]{10}$/, \\"Phone number must be 10 digits\\")\\n    .required(\\"Phone number is required\\"),\\n  password: Yup.string()\\n    .required(\\"Password is required\\")\\n    .min(8, \\"Password must be at least 8 characters\\"),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Integrate React Hook Form with the Validation Schema\\n\\nUse the `useForm` hook from React Hook Form and pass in the Yup schema using the resolver:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport { useForm } from \\"react-hook-form\\";\\nimport { yupResolver } from \\"@hookform/resolvers/yup\\";\\n\\nconst {\\n  register,\\n  handleSubmit,\\n  formState: { errors },\\n} = useForm({\\n  resolver: yupResolver(validationSchema),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Create the Form Component\\n\\nBuild the form using standard HTML elements and register each input with React Hook Form:\\n\\n```jsx\\n<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\\n  <div>\\n    <label>Full Name</label>\\n    <input type=\\"text\\" {...register(\\"fullName\\")} />\\n    {errors.fullName && <p>{errors.fullName.message}</p>}\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div>\\n    <label>Email</label>\\n    <input type=\\"email\\" {...register(\\"email\\")} />\\n    {errors.email && <p>{errors.email.message}</p>}\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div>\\n    <label>Phone Number</label>\\n    <input type=\\"text\\" {...register(\\"phoneNumber\\")} />\\n    {errors.phoneNumber && <p>{errors.phoneNumber.message}</p>}\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <div>\\n    <label>Password</label>\\n    <input type=\\"password\\" {...register(\\"password\\")} />\\n    {errors.password && <p>{errors.password.message}</p>}\\n  </div>\\n\\n  <button type=\\"submit\\">Register</button>\\n</form>\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, when the user submits the form, the `onSubmit` function is called only if all validations pass. If there are validation errors, they are displayed next to the respective fields.\\n\\n## Best Practices for Form Validation in Fintech Apps\\n\\n### 1. Provide Real-Time Feedback\\n\\nOffer immediate validation feedback as users interact with the form:\\n\\n- **OnBlur Validation**: Validate fields when they lose focus.\\n- **OnChange Validation**: Validate fields as users type.\\n\\nThis approach helps users correct errors promptly, enhancing the user experience.\\n\\n### 2. Handle Server-Side Validation\\n\\nWhile client-side validation improves usability, server-side validation is crucial for security:\\n\\n- **Duplicate Checks**: Ensure data like email or phone number isn\'t already registered.\\n- **Business Logic**: Validate data against business rules not enforceable on the client side.\\n\\nAlways validate data on the server before processing to maintain data integrity.\\n\\n### 3. Implement Conditional Validation\\n\\nUse Yup\'s conditional validation for fields that depend on others:\\n\\n```jsx\\nconst validationSchema = Yup.object().shape({\\n  hasReferral: Yup.boolean(),\\n  referralCode: Yup.string().when(\\"hasReferral\\", {\\n    is: true,\\n    then: Yup.string().required(\\"Referral code is required\\"),\\n    otherwise: Yup.string().notRequired(),\\n  }),\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThis ensures that fields like \'referralCode\' are only required when applicable.\\n\\n### 4. Localize Validation Messages\\n\\nFor fintech apps serving diverse user bases, localize validation messages:\\n\\n- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Use libraries like i18next to manage translations.\\n- **Dynamic Messages**: Provide error messages in the user\'s preferred language.\\n\\nThis practice improves accessibility and user satisfaction.\\n\\n### 5. Secure Sensitive Data\\n\\nEnsure that sensitive information is handled securely:\\n\\n- **Input Masking**: Mask inputs like passwords or account numbers.\\n- **Secure Transmission**: Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.\\n- **Data Storage**: Avoid storing sensitive data on the client side.\\n\\nImplementing these measures protects user data and builds trust.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nEffective form validation in fintech applications is vital for data integrity, security, and user trust. By leveraging React Hook Form and Yup, developers can create robust, user-friendly forms that meet the stringent requirements of the financial industry.\\n\\nImplementing best practices such as comprehensive schemas, real-time feedback, server-side validation, and secure data handling ensures that your fintech app provides a reliable and secure user experience."},{"id":"cron-health-laravel","metadata":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/cron-health-laravel","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-22-cron-health-laravel.md","title":"Cron Health in Laravel: A Practical Monitoring Setup","description":"Ensuring your background jobs and scheduled tasks run reliably is essential for any modern web application.

It\u2019s a powerful tool and provides rich diagnostics - like stack traces, job context, and alerting capabilities - which can be incredibly helpful when debugging production issues. However, for our use case, the **cost became a constraint**.\\n\\nSentry\u2019s free tier is quite limited: it includes only **one cron monitor**, and after that, they charge based on the number of monitors and event volume. For teams running multiple background jobs, scheduled tasks, or high-throughput queues, it\u2019s easy to **outgrow the free plan quickly**. Once you cross the free limits, pricing scales up significantly, especially if you want detailed event retention, multiple projects, or alerting features.\\n\\nWe needed a **free or low-cost alternative** that still gave us insight into what\'s happening behind the scenes - without the pricing model scaling steeply as our system grows.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why Healthchecks.io Works (for Cron)\\n\\nI\u2019ve continued using [**Healthchecks.io**](https://healthchecks.io/) to track cron jobs. It\'s perfect for scheduled tasks and gives you 20 free monitors - plenty for most small to mid-sized applications.\\n\\n**Integration with Laravel is simple**, using `->pingBefore()` and `->thenPing()` in your `App\\\\Console\\\\Kernel`:\\n\\n```php\\n$schedule->command(\'your:daily-task\')\\n    ->daily()\\n    ->before(function () {\\n        Http::get(\'https://hc-ping.com/your-uuid/start\');\\n    })\\n    ->after(function () {\\n        Http::get(\'https://hc-ping.com/your-uuid\');\\n    });\\n```\\n\\nHealthchecks will notify you if a cron job **doesn\'t run**, **takes too long**, or **fails silently**\u2014and that\u2019s invaluable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Understanding Cron Monitoring (Sync vs Async)\\n\\nUnlike queued jobs that run asynchronously, cron jobs in Laravel are **synchronous,** meaning the scheduler kicks them off, waits for them to finish, and then moves on. That makes them **ideal for heartbeat-based monitoring**, where a remote service like Healthchecks tracks:\\n\\n- If the job **started** (via the `/start` ping)\\n- If the job **finished** (via the default ping)\\n- If it **didn\u2019t finish in time**, or never started at all\\n\\nAnd the best part? You don\u2019t need to modify your command\u2019s internal logic\u2014just attach the `before()` and `after()` methods to your scheduler.\\n\\n## Alternative: Monitoring When Schedule Dispatches a Job\\n\\nIn some cases, your scheduled command doesn\u2019t do much by itself\u2014it simply dispatches a queued job. That makes the default `before()`/`after()` Healthchecks pings unreliable, because the command finishes immediately, while the actual work happens later in the queue.\\n\\n**Here\u2019s the fix:**\\n\\nUse the Healthchecks `start` ping **before dispatch**, and call the **success/failure pings from within the job itself.**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Flow\\n\\n1. In your **scheduled Artisan command**, ping Healthchecks `/start` **just before dispatching the job**.\\n2. In your queued job, override the `handle()` and `failed()` methods to call the **success** or **failure** ping.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n```php\\n// In your scheduled command:\\npublic function handle()\\n{\\n    // Ping start\\n    Http::get(\'https://hc-ping.com/your-uuid/start\');\\n\\n    // Dispatch the actual job\\n    YourQueuedJob::dispatch();\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n```php\\n// In your queued job:\\nuse Illuminate\\\\Support\\\\Facades\\\\Http;\\n\\nclass YourQueuedJob implements ShouldQueue\\n{\\n    public function handle()\\n    {\\n        // Do the work...\\n\\n        // Ping success\\n        Http::get(\'https://hc-ping.com/your-uuid\');\\n    }\\n\\n    public function failed(\\\\Throwable $exception)\\n    {\\n        // Ping failure\\n        Http::get(\'https://hc-ping.com/your-uuid/fail\');\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n> This method ensures you monitor the actual logic, not just the wrapper command. It\u2019s especially useful for jobs that might take time or fail in unexpected ways.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Securing and Scaling This Setup\\n\\n### 1. Store Ping URLs in `.env`\\n\\nHardcoding your ping URLs is okay for a quick test, but in production, keep it clean:\\n\\n```\\nHEALTHCHECK_PING_DAILY_REPORT=https://hc-ping.com/uuid-1234\\nHEALTHCHECK_PING_DAILY_REPORT_START=https://hc-ping.com/uuid-1234/start\\n\\n```\\n\\nThen in `Kernel.php`:\\n\\n```php\\n$schedule->command(\'report:daily\')\\n    ->daily()\\n    ->before(fn () => Http::get(env(\'HEALTHCHECK_PING_DAILY_REPORT_START\')))\\n    ->after(fn () => Http::get(env(\'HEALTHCHECK_PING_DAILY_REPORT\')));\\n\\n```\\n\\n### 2.

With the rise of digital platforms and mobile apps, LAS is becoming more accessible than ever, especially in a dynamic market like India. Here\u2019s a deep dive into what LAS entails, the key players involved, and how seamless it has become to build a mobile app for lending against securities.\\n\\n**What is Loan Against Securities (LAS)?**\\n\\nLoan Against Securities is a financing option where borrowers pledge their financial assets - such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds, or insurance policies - as collateral to secure a loan. Instead of selling their investments, individuals can borrow funds against them, typically at competitive interest rates, while retaining ownership and the potential for future gains. In India, LAS has gained traction as a flexible and efficient way to meet short-term liquidity needs, whether for personal expenses, business funding, or emergency requirements.\\n\\nThe process is straightforward: the borrower pledges their securities, the lender evaluates the collateral\u2019s value, and a loan is disbursed, usually ranging from 50-80% of the asset\u2019s market value (known as the Loan-to-Value or LTV ratio). Once the loan is repaid, the securities are unpledged, returning full control to the borrower.\\n\\n**Key Players in the LAS Ecosystem**  \\nThe LAS framework involves three critical stakeholders working in tandem:\\n\\n1. Borrower/Investor with Holdings: This is the individual or entity holding securities - be it equity shares, mutual fund units, or other eligible assets - who needs liquidity but doesn\u2019t want to sell their investments.\\n2. Intermediaries for Pledging Assets (API Providers): These are the technology-driven facilitators that make LAS seamless. Intermediaries such as depositories (e.g., NSDL, CDSL), API providers, and fintech platforms handle the pledging process. Notably, CAMS (Computer Age Management Services) and KFintech (KFin Technologies) play a pivotal role in the Indian market, especially for Loan Against Mutual Funds (LAMF). They provide APIs that enable secure and efficient pledging, revoking, and invoking of mutual fund assets. These Registrar and Transfer Agents (RTAs) integrate with lenders and depositories to verify holdings, mark liens on mutual fund units, and ensure compliance with regulatory norms set by SEBI and RBI. Their APIs streamline the process, offering real-time data and automation for a paperless experience.\\n3. Lender Providing the Loan: Banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and fintech lenders are the primary institutions offering LAS. They assess the collateral, determine the loan amount, and disburse funds. Leading players in India include HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, and newer fintech entrants leveraging technology for faster processing.\\n\\n**Building a Mobile App for LAS: Embedding Convenience**  \\nThe digitization of financial services has paved the way for mobile apps to become the go-to solution for LAS. Such an app can either be a standalone platform or embedded into existing mobile banking or investment apps through hosted flows or SDKs (Software Development Kits). Here\u2019s how it can transform the LAS experience:\\n\\n- Seamless Integration: By embedding LAS functionality into an existing app (e.g., a stock trading or mutual fund platform), users can access loans without leaving their familiar ecosystem. Hosted flows allow lenders to offer a white-labeled solution, while SDKs enable customization for a branded experience.\\n- End-to-End Automation: A well-designed app can handle everything - from showcasing eligible securities and calculating loan amounts to pledging assets and signing agreements - all within a few taps.\\n\\n**KYC and Loan Disbursement Made Simple**  \\nRegulatory compliance is a cornerstone of LAS, and mobile apps can streamline this process:\\n\\n- Digital KYC: Using Aadhaar-based e-KYC or video KYC, borrowers can verify their identity in minutes, adhering to RBI guidelines. APIs from trusted providers can fetch and validate user data securely.\\n- Loan Disbursement: Once KYC is complete and securities are pledged, the app can trigger instant loan disbursement to the borrower\u2019s bank account. Real-time updates on loan status enhance transparency and trust.\\n\\n**Flexible EMI Collection**  \\nRepayment is a critical aspect of LAS, and mobile apps can offer borrowers flexibility and control:\\n\\n- Customizable EMIs: During the loan application process, users can select their preferred repayment tenure and EMI amount based on their financial capacity. The app can display a repayment schedule upfront.\\n- Automated Collections: With integrations like NACH (National Automated Clearing House) mandates, EMIs can be deducted automatically from the borrower\u2019s account, reducing the risk of defaults. Push notifications and reminders ensure borrowers stay on track.\\n\\n**Why LAS Apps Are Growing & the Disbursements Are Increasing in Alarming Numbers:**  \\nIndia\u2019s booming investment culture and widespread smartphone adoption make LAS apps a perfect fit. They empower investors to access liquidity without disrupting long-term goals, while businesses save time and resources by leveraging pre-built tools.\\nAs the Indian market embraces digital transformation, building a mobile app for Loan Against Securities isn\u2019t just an opportunity - it\u2019s a necessity. By bridging the gap between investors, intermediaries, and lenders, these apps can redefine how liquidity is accessed, making financial flexibility a reality for millions.\\n\\nFor fintechs and banks, embedding LAS via our SDKs or workflows - powered by intermediaries like CAMS and KFintech - unlocks cross-selling opportunities and boosts customer retention without the headache of coding from scratch.\\n\\nAre you ready to tap into this growing space? The future of LAS is mobile, and the time to seize this opportunity is now!"},{"id":"ai-agents","metadata":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/ai-agents","source":"@site/blog/2025-04-07-ai-agents.md","title":"AI Agents Are Here: Will They Replace Human Jobs or Help Them?","description":"AI (Artificial Intelligence) is no longer just a tool\u2014it\u2019s now working alongside us.

Apart from using right fonts, it explains how text looks, feels, and guides the reader\u2019s experience. \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e The right typography makes content easy to read, sets the mood, and even influences how people perceive a brand or product.\\n\\nTypography plays a key role in UI and visual design because it directly affects readability, usability, and the overall feel of a product. Well-chosen fonts create hierarchy, guide users through content effortlessly, and make interfaces intuitive. Good typography enhances accessibility, ensuring text is easy to read for everyone, while also reinforcing a brand\u2019s personality.\\n\\nHere\u2019s how conscious choices in typography can elevate both aesthetics and usability.\\n\\n## 1. Vibe Check!\\n\\nBefore choosing a typeface (_the overall design of a set of characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols, that share a consistent style_), consider the product\u2019s personality. Fonts (_a specific variation of a typeface, including details like weight (bold, light), style (italic, regular), and size_) shape perception, usability, and brand identity.\\n\\n- **Serif** \u2192 Serif typeface evoke a sense of tradition, trust, and sophistication. Their small decorative strokes give them a classic, authoritative feel, making them ideal for conveying credibility and elegance.\\n  Great for editorial platforms, finance, luxury brands.\\n  (e.g., Times New Roman, Garamond)\\n- **Sans-Serif** \u2192 Sans-serif typeface feel clean, minimal, and highly readable. With their simple, stroke-free design, they create a contemporary, approachable, and user-friendly vibe.\\n  Perfect for tech, startups, apps, minimalist branding.\\n  (e.g., Helvetica, Roboto, Inter)\\n- **Script** \u2192 They give a sense of elegance, and artistry. Their flowing, handwritten style adds warmth and expressiveness, making them ideal for designs that aim to feel personal, stylish, or decorative.\\n  Best for branding, invitations, creative industries\\n  (e.g., Pacifico, Lobster)\\n- **Monospace** \u2192 They create a structured, precise, and technical feel. They evoke a sense of clarity and functionality, making them ideal for displaying code, system text, or data-driven content.\\n  Works for developer tools, coding interfaces, tech-heavy branding.\\n  (e.g., Courier, Space Mono)\\n\\n## 2. Readability & Accessibility\\n\\n- **Legibility**\\n  \u2192 Can you tell letters apart? similar characters like \\"l\\" and \\"1\\" or \\"o\\" and \\"0\\" can create confusion among readers which can lead to them creating mistakes which can cost users a lot of their time and resources. Choosing fonts with high legibility is essential in interfaces where quick reading is required, such as dashboards, forms, and navigation menus.\\n- **Readibiliity**\\n  \u2192 Does it feel comfortable to read? Proper font size, line height, and spacing help ensure that users don\u2019t struggle with text-heavy content. Lines that are too close together or too long can make reading exhausting, while overly decorative or condensed fonts slow down reading speed and comprehension. Breaking up text into digestible sections, using clear hierarchy, and aligning text properly all contribute to a better reading experience.\\n- **Inclusivity**\\n  \u2192 Dyslexia-friendly fonts, increased letter spacing, and high contrast improve accessibility for users with visual impairments or reading disorders. Adjusting letter and word spacing prevents text from feeling too dense, while using softer contrast (like dark gray text on an off-white background) reduces glare and eye strain.\\n\\n## 3. Font Size & Hierarchy\\n\\n- **Size & Weight**  \\n  \u2192 Larger and heavier fonts naturally stand out, making them perfect for headlines, calls to action, or key information that needs emphasis. On the other hand, body text should be lighter and appropriately sized to maintain readability over long passages, ensuring users don\u2019t feel overwhelmed or fatigued while reading.\\n- **Hierarchy for Scannability**\\n  \u2192 Users don\u2019t read everything, they scan for relevant information, and a clear heading structure makes this process faster and more intuitive. A well-structured hierarchy visually organizes content, allowing users to quickly understand the main points before diving into details.\\n- **Proximity Principle**\\n  \u2192 When related elements are placed close together, users instinctively understand that they belong to the same category or topic, reducing cognitive load. Proper spacing between unrelated sections helps avoid visual clutter, making the layout feel cleaner and more organized.\\n\\n## 4. Contrast & Color\\n\\n- **Keep it Simple**\\n  \u2192 High contrast between text and background makes reading effortless, especially for users with visual impairments or color blindness. However, using pure black text on a pure white background creates excessive strain due to the stark contrast, so softer shades like dark gray on off-white improve comfort without sacrificing readability.\\n- **UI Color Cues**\\n- **Red**\\n  Red is associated with urgency and danger, making it the go-to color for error messages, alerts, or anything that requires immediate attention. It naturally grabs the eye, helping users quickly recognize mistakes in forms, payment failures, or system warnings.\\n- **Yellow**\\n  Yellow signals caution or important, non-critical alerts, often used in warnings that don\u2019t require urgent action. It also works well for drawing subtle attention to tooltips, notifications, or key UI elements without overwhelming the user.\\n- **Blue**\\n  Blue is commonly used in corporate, financial, and tech interfaces because it conveys reliability, calmness, and security. It\u2019s often the default color for hyperlinks and UI elements that require user interaction, reinforcing familiarity and dependability.\\n- **Green**\\n  Green is associated with positive outcomes, such as successful transactions, completed actions, or system confirmations. It\u2019s also linked to eco-friendly initiatives, health-related content, and UI elements that encourage progress or approval.\\n\\n## 5. Break the Rules (Once in a While)\\n\\nTypography comes with best practices, but sometimes the most memorable designs emerge when those rules are intentionally bent. Experimenting with oversized fonts, unconventional layouts, or bold contrasts can inject personality and emotion into a design, making it stand out. This approach works especially well in branding, editorial design, and creative campaigns where uniqueness matters.\\n\\nA great example is **Spotify Wrapped**, which uses a mix of loud, distorted typography, unexpected angles, and vibrant colors to create an energetic and playful visual language. Despite breaking traditional readability rules, it resonates with users because it aligns with the fun, dynamic nature of the content. The key is to break conventions with purpose\u2014pushing creative boundaries while still ensuring usability. When done right, experimental typography transforms a product from just functional to something users genuinely love interacting with."},{"id":"kafka-streaming-for-live-currency-rates","metadata":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/kafka-streaming-for-live-currency-rates","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-15-kafka-streaming.md","title":"Kafka Streaming for Live Currency Rates","description":"Problem Statement","date":"2025-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Rakshith V S","title":"Full Stack Developer","url":"https://github.com/RakshithBeta","page":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/authors/rakshith"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/im_Rakshith_","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rakshith1999/"},"imageURL":"/pr-preview/pr-42/img/blogs/AuthorProfile/rakshith.jpeg","key":"Rakshith"},{"name":"Shreekant totla","title":"Full Stack Developer","url":"https://github.com/Shreekant-totla","page":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/authors/shreekant"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/shreekant_totla","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shreekant-totla-9484811a7"},"imageURL":"/pr-preview/pr-42/img/blogs/AuthorProfile/shreekant.jpeg","key":"Shreekant"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"kafka-streaming-for-live-currency-rates","title":"Kafka Streaming for Live Currency Rates","authors":["Rakshith","Shreekant"],"image":"https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/502rnJxNrX6JVYCUa9wjOe/b853ef9440c5d072a051b637c9c678c9/kafka-hero.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Typography in UI Design: Points to consider while designing","permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/typography-in-ui-design"},"nextItem":{"title":"Building Asset Monitoring Systems for Lending Apps | Secured Lending Solutions","permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/asset-monitoring-system-lending-apps"}},"content":"## Problem Statement\\n\\nIn the fintech world, live currency rate streaming is a critical feature that ensures users receive real-time updates on exchange rates. Our challenge was to build a **continuous live rate streaming system** for Real-Time Currency Exchange Rates that updates **every second** \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e for multiple currency pairs and serves **multiple users concurrently**. Traditional database-driven approaches struggled with performance bottlenecks, latency, and scalability issues, prompting us to explore a more robust solution.\\n\\n## Why Not a Normal PostgreSQL Database?\\n\\nWhile PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database, it was not well-suited for real-time, high-frequency data streaming due to the following reasons:\\n\\n1. **High Write and Read Latency:** Storing every second\u2019s rate updates would lead to frequent write operations, causing significant latency when querying real-time data.\\n2. **Scalability Issues:** A large number of concurrent users fetching live rates would overload the database, leading to slow response times.\\n3. **Polling Inefficiency:** Fetching the latest rates via polling would increase database load and lead to unnecessary resource consumption.\\n4. **Event-Driven Processing Challenges:** A traditional database does not natively support event-driven architectures, making real-time processing complex.\\n\\n## Why We Used Kafka?\\n\\nTo address these challenges, we chose **Apache Kafka** as the backbone of our live rate streaming system. Here\u2019s why:\\n\\n1. **Real-Time Data Streaming:** Kafka\u2019s publish-subscribe model allows us to **continuously push live rates** without querying a database.\\n2. **High Throughput and Low Latency:** Kafka can handle millions of messages per second with minimal latency, ensuring seamless rate updates.\\n3. **Scalability:** It supports partitioning, allowing horizontal scaling as the number of users grows.\\n4. **Fault Tolerance:** Kafka\u2019s distributed architecture ensures data durability and prevents single points of failure.\\n5. **Decoupling Producers and Consumers:** Currency rate providers (producers) can push data independently of users (consumers), reducing bottlenecks.\\n6. **Efficient Data Processing:** Kafka integrates well with stream processing frameworks like Apache Flink or Kafka Streams to process and analyze data in real time.\\n\\n## Implementation Overview\\n\\n1. **Data Source Integration:** We fetch live currency rates from multiple financial market APIs.\\n2. **Kafka Producer:** A producer service ingests real-time currency rates into **Kafka topics**.\\n3. **Kafka Topics & Partitioning:** All currency pair details are received from a single subscribed topic, rather than separate topics for each pair, ensuring centralized data access.\\n4. **Kafka Consumer:** User applications subscribe to relevant topics to receive **instant rate updates**.\\n5. **WebSockets for UI Updates:** A WebSocket layer pushes live rate updates to the front end, ensuring a smooth real-time experience.\\n6. **Monitoring & Alerts:** Kafka\u2019s built-in metrics and third-party tools (Prometheus, Grafana) monitor system performance.\\n\\n## Additional Considerations\\n\\n- **Message Retention:** We configured a short retention period since users only need the latest rate.\\n- **Backpressure Handling:** Implemented a rate limiter to prevent overwhelming consumers.\\n- **Security & Authentication:** Used Kafka ACLs and SSL encryption to secure data transmission.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nUsing Kafka for real-time currency rate streaming enabled us to build a scalable, low-latency, and fault-tolerant system that efficiently handles high-frequency updates for multiple users. This approach significantly outperformed traditional database-driven methods, making Kafka the perfect choice for our use case."},{"id":"asset-monitoring-system-lending-apps","metadata":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/asset-monitoring-system-lending-apps","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-17-asset-monitoring-system.md","title":"Building Asset Monitoring Systems for Lending Apps | Secured Lending Solutions","description":"Learn how to build a robust asset monitoring system for secured lending apps.

We have seen an influx of new players in the market offering innovative credit solutions, enabling users to spend cash on credit or purchase goods using Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services. Adopting such financial products is widespread across various platforms\u2014whether booking a flight through MakeMyTrip or purchasing goods on Amazon using Amazon Pay. With increasing demand and continuous innovation, the credit ecosystem is expanding rapidly, opening new opportunities in digital lending.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Secured Lending Apps: Lending Against Collateral**\\n\\nA new and promising avenue in the lending landscape is the rise of **secured lending platforms** that offer loans against pledged assets. Unlike traditional unsecured lending, where credit is extended based on income and creditworthiness, these platforms allow users to leverage financial assets such as **stocks, mutual funds, or gold** to secure loans. This approach ensures **lower risk for lenders** while offering borrowers **lower interest rates** compared to unsecured loans.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **How Secured Lending Works**\\n\\n1. **Asset Pledging**: The borrower pledges a portion of their financial assets (e.g., stocks, mutual funds, gold) as collateral.\\n2. **Loan to Value (LTV) Calculation**: The lender determines the loan amount based on the value of the pledged asset. Typically, the LTV ratio ranges from **50% to 70%**.\\n3. **Loan Disbursal**: Once the LTV is calculated, the loan amount is credited to the borrower\'s account.\\n4. **Asset Monitoring**: Since pledged assets are market-dependent, their value fluctuates, necessitating **continuous monitoring**.\\n5. **Loan Repayment & Asset Release**: The borrower repays the loan, and upon successful repayment, the pledged asset is released back to the borrower.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Challenges in Building Secured Lending Apps**\\n\\nBuilding an application facilitating **loans against securities (LAS)** presents unique technical and financial challenges. The primary concerns revolve around **market fluctuations, risk mitigation, and seamless integration** with financial data providers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. Dynamic Nature of Pledged Assets**\\n\\nUnlike fixed assets, financial securities such as **stocks and mutual funds** are subject to **market volatility**. This fluctuating nature poses a risk to lenders. The lender could suffer financial losses if the asset\u2019s value drops significantly below the LTV threshold.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Continuous Asset Monitoring System**\\n\\nTo mitigate risks, we implemented a **real-time monitoring system** that tracks the value of pledged assets throughout the loan tenure. This system works as follows:\\n\\n- **Data Collection**: Asset prices are continuously fetched via **market APIs**.\\n- **Threshold Alerts**: The system compares current asset values with the pledged value at loan initiation.\\n- **Risk Identification**: The loan is flagged as at-risk if the LTV ratio crosses a predefined risk threshold.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Automated Risk Alert System**\\n\\nOur **alert mechanism** ensures timely intervention in case of adverse market movements:\\n\\n- **Danger Zone Detection**: An alert is generated if the asset value declines beyond an acceptable limit.\\n- **Customer Notification**: The customer is informed about the shortfall, prompting them to repay a portion of the loan or pledge additional assets.\\n- **Loan Management Actions**: In case of prolonged devaluation, the lender can take appropriate action, such as liquidating part of the pledged asset to recover the outstanding loan.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. Third-Party Data Integrations**\\n\\nIntegrating third-party services is a crucial yet complex aspect of building secured lending applications. Financial data providers such as **CAMS/Karvy** for market and user holdings data, **Razorpay** for payment gateway processing, and **Digio** for autopay setup ensure smooth operations.\\n\\nHowever, these integrations come with challenges, including maintaining **data integrity, ensuring immutability, and managing historical records** for auditing.

Is There Really No Server?\\n\\nHave you ever heard the term **\\"serverless\\"** and wondered what it means? Does it mean there\u2019s no server at all? If there\u2019s a server, why do we call it **serverless**? \uD83E\uDD14\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nLearn when and why to use Cloudflare Workers for serverless computing. Explore how it works, its benefits, and real-world use cases. Dive into the future of serverless architecture with Betalectic.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **What Does Serverless Actually Mean?**\\n\\nServerless doesn\u2019t mean there are no servers\u2014it just means you don\u2019t have to worry about them. Cloud providers like Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, and Google Cloud Functions take care of everything behind the scenes, including servers, scaling, and maintenance. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called \\"serverless\\"\u2014you don\u2019t have to deal with servers directly. You write and deploy your code, and the platform runs it whenever needed. Plus, you only pay for what you use instead of keeping a server running all the time, making it a flexible and cost-effective choice.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **How Does Serverless Work?**\\n\\nWhen you deploy a serverless function, it doesn\u2019t run all the time like a traditional server. Instead, it **executes only when triggered**\u2014for example, when a user requests data from an API or visits a webpage. The cloud provider automatically starts the function, runs the code, and then shuts it down when it\u2019s done.\\n\\nThis **event-driven execution model** makes serverless highly **efficient, scalable, and cost-effective**. Since the platform scales automatically, your application can handle a single or millions of requests without manual intervention.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Cloudflare Workers**\\n\\nImagine if your website could run fast no matter where your users are. That\u2019s precisely what **Cloudflare Workers** do! They let you run code on Cloudflare\u2019s massive network of **300+ data centers worldwide**, so instead of waiting for a request to travel across the internet to a faraway server; it gets processed **closer to the user**\u2014making everything load **much faster**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **How Cloudflare Workers Work**\\n\\nThink of Cloudflare Workers as tiny, on-demand programs that run whenever someone visits your site or uses your API. Here\u2019s what happens step by step:\\n\\n1. ### A User Makes a Request\\n\\nWhen someone visits your site or calls your API, instead of going to a traditional server, the request is sent to the **nearest Cloudflare data center**. This saves time by reducing how far the data has to travel.\\n\\n2. ### The Worker Runs Instantly\\n\\nOnce the request reaches Cloudflare, the Worker **executes your code on demand**. It runs in a super lightweight and isolated environment (powered by the same V8 engine as Chrome and Node.js).\\n\\n3. ### A Response is Sent Back \u2013 Fast!\\n\\nThe Worker can do all sorts of things\u2014fetch data, modify responses, check authentication, cache content, and more. Once done, the response **returns to the user from the closest edge server**, making everything feel snappy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Why Use Cloudflare Workers?**\\n\\nHere\u2019s what makes Workers awesome:\\n\\n\u2705 **No Servers to Manage** \u2013 Write your code, deploy it, and Cloudflare handles everything. You won\'t need to worry about setting up or maintaining servers.\\n\\n\u2705 **Scales Instantly** \u2013 Whether you get **1 request or 1 million**, Cloudflare Workers scale automatically, ensuring smooth performance.\\n\\n\u2705 **Runs Everywhere** \u2013 Unlike traditional cloud servers locked to a specific region, Workers **run globally** on Cloudflare\u2019s network.\\n\\n\u2705 **Only Pay for What You Use** \u2013 Workers run only when needed, so you don\u2019t have to pay for idle servers.\\n\\n\u2705 **Secure by Design** \u2013 Workers run in a **sandboxed** environment, protecting your app from security threats.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **What Can You Build with Cloudflare Workers?**\\n\\n\uD83D\uDD39 **API Gateway** \u2013 Manage API requests and modify responses without a backend.\\n\\n\uD83D\uDD39 **Authentication & Security** \u2013 Validate JWT tokens, block bad traffic, and add security headers.\\n\\n\uD83D\uDD39 **Edge Caching** \u2013 Store API responses and static content at the edge to speed things up.\\n\\n\uD83D\uDD39 **Dynamic Content Rewriting** \u2013 Modify requests before they reach your server.\\n\\n\uD83D\uDD39 **Serverless Applications** \u2013 Build URL shorteners, real-time webhooks, and microservices.\\n\\n---\\n\\nCloudflare Workers make it **super easy** to build **fast, secure, and scalable** applications **without managing infrastructure**. Since they run on the edge, your code executes closer to users, reducing delays and improving performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **When Should You Use Cloudflare Workers?**\\n\\n### **1. Low-Latency Applications**\\nIf your application requires **real-time responses** (e.g., gaming, live chat, or financial transactions), Cloudflare Workers can reduce latency by processing requests closer to the user.\\n\\n### **2. Global Applications**\\nFor applications with a **global user base**, Workers ensure consistent performance by running code in the data center closest to the user.\\n\\n### **3. High-Traffic Applications**\\nIf your application experiences **spikes in traffic** (e.g., during product launches or events), Workers scale automatically to handle the load without downtime.\\n\\n### **4. Cost-Effective Solutions**\\nIf you want to **reduce infrastructure costs**, Workers allow you to pay only for the compute time you use, eliminating the need for idle servers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\n\\nCloudflare Workers are a **game-changer** for modern web development. By leveraging serverless computing at the edge, you can build **fast, secure, and scalable** applications without worrying about infrastructure. Whether building an API gateway, optimizing content delivery, or creating serverless microservices, Cloudflare Workers provide the tools you need to succeed.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re ready to explore the power of serverless computing, start with **[Cloudflare\u2019s Workers Playground](https://workers.cloudflare.com/playground#LYVwNgLglgDghgJwgegGYHsHALQBM4RwDcABAEbogB2+CAngLzbPYDqApmQNJQQBimYACFKNRHQBqADVwBNAI50oABjIBlAJLKAorKggAXCxYduvAVhHVakmQqWrNOvSACwAKADC6KhHa-sABEoAGcYdBDeKB8DEgwsPAJiEio4YHYGACJ8QgA6ACsQzNJUKDB-NIzspIKij29ffwhsABU6GHZYuBgYMCgAYwJoqmR8uAA3OBD+hFgIAGpgdFxwdg8PdgAPcKQSXHZUOHAIEgBvdwBIVPTYzO1NtN72EgBBAAUNTIAaS8IAcxCsQA2pkto9yt8SJlulBIZkEOwwj4QuxMgBdH4AXyI7g8xmYph4-EEVjE9GkckUKnUWl0+nqPj8AWCSMi0BicUEiUIpGuVSgNC2tWKcTKFXSWQF+02woZjQCbQ6XR6fUG7JGY0m01mMAWSxW5XW7igwB2JwA7uwwP10Ok4ghbVDLdbbexcgALCDAMDFdzuZAAKgD7hIAZIAAEIO12PtUGcAPJkfLsfoQTEkbRUcYhgPIP1bM17A5HSBnS6B4MXUMR+AINJnABK7HkIERaZICJbbcu1fDtfrp0z43T-mzVbDfcQA-uKZA6oafk27dTmx7E4REBACCoITObwdwFC7AAPE2kTv2AA+TFrvMXKZ0Kj9OLsCD9d0ACk7rZCEC+JFHf8VwASjLC4LhtHcTi3MASAYFJ2HNEgAFUGwAGS-ZsfwgXIYOAnFwMgkJ0HKXIwHQP4PwAAwACStciSAAElOVJxigP4CEwXCUQQF4-iadMCBIeAIHdJjThg3IRPdPlMQAQio-C-XAqA4w-STpL5OCGHgzJkBhTJQPOcCLmQZASFkSgSBtcBcBIOAwGI6yHNguASFEqAEDs2so1eD4SHddgEUuQjkROHI3PguBzTgXgSBNM0P0yXJkAi4UlJMjctyoEgz3CC9ah8D8Ioyi4b3ArLtwQpC8uRdgP2dG10n-YzwMCuB9gQQEwJMzJIKZZoow6TJbkXFBPW9b4QrKn5wMxDLMSxHE8XxQlzBJUQbApexqScOk3C8RkmiCUJwjZYZYniHAIt5Soska10PS9H0SjFPl7qtJq3Qmn05QG1po1iMbkF6WKqCNY85MCeNPBaWQ3m0ALnsvdxjx+kgwDgKg-iyfxMhRi40fYDqCcJ9JCGs91EBRCAsmQlo+GwAAOTISGQUnj3JtzPQgGBsCwqBxiyKRsGQl5sG8U0hjICFrKO3wsg0bQGBjfjWfZkLOdfNz3syNjELNVn+qae6oFwUSGH2Nj+nYbBzTN0T-wFKIHOwaYHIyABGXJlHVjnoAgcpL08ciQFwVBMYREhWEwABrILdzeTG6D+B1rGPZAA6DzW+ioWPpoRMAsl-OhyhCQLX0yab3QRVAsh5mBATM0GU7TmhcitmAHVwXJ+lD8PI7dK3kAe9I3ajUj+hCIoQo1wnkHa3AUcuY8KFwOgOdwQXrMx6esgjxBEXx6bjxNP4SBCBB+nriBeabkHk9TzaO-YcYu+WXv+4PhEX-GNBB5CFJbGftNapUFhzYAYNSaEy3uMHeUwQj3TjgnbA5E-joHxhnWB0DjwwGgRcDgLp0hyRQiidy7pQgkCTnAVum13LoHcm2PYsxxjPDcjHBA8cEBAQRAQNhRYlj0Omhccuh8SA+Fzuwf8WM7LmkCjlXh68iy9HQHQPYnkUyBzURABholniq2eGQNRNNoDYxICAGA9lhEh0oAPMRcB+g2V8LkE+IMcHuk9peVgVMTiUPYcghAAB+DOHicF4OES8EgNiw7f2eBwrh8VdwACkJhwDUDMOYct9gkDoFZc0sw-DkKElTGgZccmUAQCQS0ZBhFsnYAAcl3DRFoLQ3juTrKgUoz4t4IlTGANRAoolf0Ho0gCuB+IY3QGqYYu5EB0L0cI80mAwC4GkWAci9szG5JAPQyZapng2myX3CIzwdHlK3ABGg5ieK7kGZgTqQiTIXAROeOyZy9HABIEsKOLYBix36a48JJk0aeJaPQeKJxtldStKgEJniT5ApMvGHKUKMYHF8bMi+4I4kBKKRijs1AqACnPj4chlC6m5AslZQYVBhExjinFPorD7JXJRKcwKHZETHF3IFH+GYt4nD0cJAgYk4AUGZWc-SMAoCPJMmygK6AkJCrBKaco0dcUlNwGUrenSgpNA7JQPwgCqU7JpfZRyDD6UQGEUKw5pyGHyrkQQUZZ1IgyzYVcsgswtkVIQkueK+w3JnL6KgN0gKObIEgQKAmGc14b1RgvZGuJ3D4jYJwIkFhhCbXENtKkjhaQuD+sdFkZ0ogciutyZIusuYRRFKUousZboDIJkItCpAb2RVAMIYPhRjEXBsm04fVbQiSgGQMovA6AAH0ciogMJkAATMoBdAAWbAygADM66ADs3xh1S2gOOvoUYp0HwBCNEEVBljsEKFOpqIl0RfEyFGqgU79SrBGpkKUQpCiZExCtYwa1iSWGzeSOweaaTOH0MwDwQA) or deploy your first Worker in minutes!\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Ready to Build with Cloudflare Workers?**\\nIf you want to implement a high-performance, serverless solution with Cloudflare Workers, **Betalectic** can help.

[ Best Practices and Tips](#7-best-practices-and-tips)\\n\\n8.  [ Conclusion](#8-conclusion)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Introduction to Real-Time Bidding and Auctions\\n\\n**What is real-time bidding (RTB)?**\\n\\nReal-time bidding refers to the process of making live offers or bids in a fraction of a second while an auction is ongoing. In an online auction environment, multiple bidders simultaneously submit their bids on an item (or multiple items) within a specified timeframe. The goal is to capture each bid accurately, determine the highest valid offer, and then display the latest leading bid to all participants in real time.\\n\\n**Key challenges:**\\n\\n- **Concurrency**: Multiple bidders submitting offers at the same time.\\n- **Ordering**: Ensuring that each bid is processed in the correct sequence.\\n- **Scalability**: Handling multiple concurrent auctions without performance degradation.\\n- **Real-time updates**: Notifying all bidders of the latest bid status as soon as possible.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Core Architecture Overview\\n\\nA robust real-time auction platform typically involves the following components:\\n\\n1. **Front-End**: Displays the auction interface, shows real-time bid updates, and captures user bids.\\n2. **Queue**: Ensures reliable, ordered message handling for incoming bids.\\n3. **Processing Layer**: A serverless or microservices layer that processes each bid and updates the system state.\\n4. **Real-Time Notification Service**: Broadcasts live updates to all participants.\\n5. **Database**: Stores bid history, user data, and auction details.\\n\\nBelow is a high-level architecture:\\n\\n```mermaid\\nflowchart LR\\n    A[Bidders] --\x3e|Submit Bid| B[Front-End]\\n    B --\x3e|Send Bid<br>to SQS FIFO| C[SQS FIFO Queue]\\n    C --\x3e|Trigger Lambda| D[AWS Lambda]\\n    D --\x3e|Update Auction<br>State| E[Database]\\n    D --\x3e|Publish<br>New Bid Event| F[Pusher]\\n    F --\x3e|Real-time Updates| B\\n\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Why Amazon SQS FIFO Queues?\\n\\n**Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)** is a fully managed message queuing service from AWS. The FIFO (First-In-First-Out) variant guarantees that messages (bids) are processed in the exact order they are received and that each message is processed exactly once. This is critical in an auction environment where the timing and sequence of bids can determine the winner.\\n\\n### Key Benefits of SQS FIFO:\\n\\n- **Ordering Guarantee**: Ensures the first bid is processed first, preventing race conditions.\\n- **Exactly-Once Processing**: Avoids the dreaded \\"double-processing\\" of a single bid.\\n- **High Throughput**: Scales to handle thousands of messages per second.\\n- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with AWS Lambda.\\n\\nFor more details on the intricacies of FIFO queues, you can read [Solving Complex Ordering Challenges with Amazon SQS FIFO Queues](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/solving-complex-ordering-challenges-with-amazon-sqs-fifo-queues/).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Processing Bids with AWS Lambda\\n\\n**AWS Lambda** is a serverless computing service that lets you run code without managing servers. In a real-time auction scenario, each new bid triggers a Lambda function. The function then:\\n\\n1. **Validates the bid**: Checks if the bid is higher than the current highest bid, whether the auction is still open, etc.\\n2. **Updates the auction state**: Stores or updates relevant information in the database (e.g., new highest bid, bidder ID, timestamp).\\n3. **Notifies the front-end**: Publishes a message to Pusher (or another real-time messaging service) so all participants see the new highest bid.\\n\\nIn your Lambda code, you might have a structure like this:\\n\\n- **index.js**: Entry point for the Lambda, orchestrating the workflow.\\n- **processBids.js**: Contains the core business logic to validate and process bids.\\n- **Other utility files**: Handle different scenarios, such as auctions with extended bidding periods, concurrency checks, etc.\\n\\nThis modular approach keeps the code maintainable and easy to extend.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Ensuring Real-Time Updates with Pusher\\n\\nOnce a valid bid is processed, it\'s crucial to immediately broadcast the updated information to all active participants. **Pusher** is a popular real-time messaging service that makes this possible with minimal overhead. By integrating Pusher into your Lambda function:\\n\\n1. **Push New Bid Events**: Each time Lambda validates a new highest bid, it sends a push notification to a Pusher channel dedicated to that auction.\\n2. **Front-End Listeners**: The browser (or mobile app) listens for these channel events. Upon receiving a new bid event, the interface updates automatically, showing the latest highest bid and the bidder\'s details (or masked identifier).\\n\\nThis mechanism provides a **seamless** real-time experience for users, similar to a live auction house setting.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6. Handling Multiple Auctions Concurrently\\n\\nWhen you have multiple auctions running at once, concurrency can skyrocket. Here\'s how you can manage it:\\n\\n1. **Unique Identifiers**: In SQS FIFO, each auction has a unique queue group ID or message group ID to ensure that bids for different auctions don\'t mix.\\n2. **Scalable Architecture**: AWS Lambda automatically scales to handle as many concurrent invocations as needed, provided your concurrency limits are set appropriately.\\n3. **Separate Pusher Channels**: Each auction should have its own Pusher channel. This way, messages (bid updates) only go to participants in that specific auction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 7. Best Practices and Tips\\n\\n1. **Use Timeouts Wisely**: Ensure your Lambda function has an appropriate timeout setting. Your bid processing should be quick in most cases, but be mindful of edge cases like network latency.\\n2. **Implement Idempotency**: If your system somehow reprocesses a message (very rare with FIFO queues, but still possible), ensure your logic can handle duplicates gracefully.\\n3. **Monitor and Alert**: Set up CloudWatch metrics and alarms to track Lambda invocation errors, queue backlogs, or unusual spikes in bidding volume.\\n4. **Database Transactions**: Use atomic database operations (like DynamoDB\'s conditional writes or relational transactions) to ensure data consistency when updating the highest bid.\\n5. **Security**: Implement appropriate authentication and authorization, ensuring only authorized bidders can place bids and the data is transmitted securely (HTTPS/WSS).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 8. Conclusion\\n\\nBuilding a **high-performance real-time bidding and auction platform** requires careful attention to concurrency, ordering, and real-time communication. By leveraging **Amazon SQS FIFO queues** for message ordering, **AWS Lambda** for bid processing, and **Pusher** for live updates, you can create an architecture that scales automatically and provides a seamless experience for your users.\\n\\nThis combination of services allows you to handle multiple auctions concurrently with **confidence** in the accuracy of each bid. With minimal infrastructure management (thanks to serverless components), your development team can focus on enhancing user experience, implementing new features, and ensuring the platform continues to run smoothly.\\n\\nIf you\'re looking to dive deeper, make sure to check out AWS\'s official guide on [Solving Complex Ordering Challenges with Amazon SQS FIFO Queues](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/solving-complex-ordering-challenges-with-amazon-sqs-fifo-queues/). By following these best practices and leveraging the right AWS services, you can build an auction platform that is both **powerful** and **reliable**\u2014ready for the demands of real-time bidding at any scale."},{"id":"dynamic-table-component-backend-config","metadata":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/dynamic-table-component-backend-config","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-28-dynamic-table-component.md","title":"Building a Dynamic Table Component: Backend Configuration-Driven Approach","description":"Introduction","date":"2024-11-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Shrey Dhyani","title":"Software Engineer & Avid Reader","page":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/authors/all-sebastien-lorber-articles"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/ShreyDhyani","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shrey-dhyani-60a63b157/"},"imageURL":"/pr-preview/pr-42/img/blogs/AuthorProfile/shrey.jpeg","key":"shrey"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"dynamic-table-component-backend-config","title":"Building a Dynamic Table Component: Backend Configuration-Driven Approach","authors":["shrey"],"image":"https://img.freepik.com/free-vector/minimalist-project-management-daily-checklist_742173-5121.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Real-Time Bidding and Auctions: A Guide to Building a High-Performance Platform","permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/bidding-and-auctions"},"nextItem":{"title":"Building Scalable Mobile Apps for Financial Services: Key Features and Best Practices","permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/scalable-mobile-apps-financial-services"}},"content":"### **Introduction**\\n\\nIn this post, I\'ll walk you through the development of a dynamic and highly customizable table component. The key idea behind this table is its configuration-driven nature\u2014where all the features, such as column visibility, order, resizing, and more, are controlled by configurations fetched from a backend API. This allows for unparalleled flexibility and adaptability in building complex, data-heavy UIs.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n### **Why a Configuration-Driven Table?**\\n\\nModern applications often need tables that can handle various data types, support user interactions, and fit into different use cases. While building such a table from scratch could be cumbersome, a configuration-driven approach allows:\\n\\n- **Separation of concerns:** Let the backend decide on the table\'s structure, columns, and behavior.\\n- **Flexibility:** Changing the table\'s configuration requires no code changes in the frontend, making it more scalable and adaptable.\\n- **Feature-rich tables:** Easily enable or disable powerful table features like sorting, resizing, and variant control by simply updating the configuration.\\n\\n### **Key Features of the Table Component**\\n\\n#### **1. Configuration-Driven Setup**\\nThe table component fetches its entire setup from an API. This includes which columns to display, their visibility, order, and custom configurations such as alignment or variant styling. Here\'s how the table structure is controlled:\\n- **Column Definitions:** The API provides details about each column, including field name, label, and whether it\'s visible or hidden.\\n- **Visibility Rules:** Specific columns can be hidden based on roles, user preferences, or other business rules.\\n- **Dynamic Order:** The column order is not static, and the backend configuration can dictate how the columns should appear.\\n\\n#### **2. Out-of-the-Box Features**\\nTo enhance the user experience, this table component offers several built-in features:\\n- **Column Ordering:** Users can reorder columns, and these settings can be synced with the backend, ensuring the changes persist across sessions.\\n- **Column Visibility:** Users can toggle which columns to show or hide based on their preferences or needs.\\n- **Resizing:** Column widths can be adjusted to improve readability and fit more content.\\n- **Variants & Table Sizing:** The configuration also allows setting different table styles (compact, spacious, etc.) and variants (striped, bordered, etc.), giving the table a unique look-and-feel based on the context.\\n\\n#### **3. Backend-Driven Flexibility**\\nOne of the key aspects of this table is that most of its features are enabled or disabled by backend configurations. This allows for easy customization and quicker adaptations to business needs without touching frontend code. The API configuration includes:\\n- **Feature Toggles:** Resizing, sorting, and even advanced features like pagination or infinite scroll can be toggled on/off via configuration.\\n- **Responsive Design:** Backend can dictate how the table should behave at different breakpoints, ensuring optimal user experience across devices.\\n- **Theme & Styling:** Configurations can also control table styles, enabling easy changes between themes (dark/light) or modifying borders, row colors, and more.\\n\\n### **How It Works: A Closer Look at the API Configuration**\\n\\nThe heart of this table component lies in the configuration fetched from the API. Here\'s an example of what a configuration response might look like:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\"resource\\": \\"sample-data\\",\\n  \\"identifierKey\\": \\"data-value\\",\\n  \\"selectionType\\": \\"multiple\\",\\n  \\"actions\\": {\\n    \\"header\\": \\"Actions\\",\\n    \\"align\\": \\"end\\",\\n    \\"fixed\\": true,\\n    \\"minWidth\\": 200,\\n    \\"options\\": [\\n      {\\n        \\"key\\": \\"edit\\",\\n        \\"url\\": \\"/edit/:id\\",\\n        \\"icon\\": \\"SquarePen\\",\\n        \\"method\\": \\"GET\\"\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  },\\n  \\"columns\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\"accessorKey\\": \\"id\\",\\n      \\"header\\": \\"Sr no.\\",\\n      \\"width\\": 80,\\n      \\"maxWidth\\": 80,\\n      \\"minWidth\\": 80,\\n      \\"fixed\\": true\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\"accessorKey\\": \\"state\\",\\n      \\"header\\": \\"State\\",\\n      \\"width\\": 100,\\n      \\"minWidth\\": 100,\\n      \\"show\\": false\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\"filters\\": {\\n    \\"category\\": {\\n      \\"label\\": \\"Category\\",\\n      \\"type\\": \\"enum\\",\\n      \\"isNullable\\": false,\\n      \\"options\\": [\\n        {\\n          \\"label\\": \\"One\\",\\n          \\"value\\": \\"One\\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \\"label\\": \\"Two\\",\\n          \\"value\\": \\"Two\\"\\n        }\\n      ]\\n    },\\n    \\"state\\": {\\n      \\"label\\": \\"State\\",\\n      \\"type\\": \\"enum\\",\\n      \\"isNullable\\": false,\\n      \\"modelName\\": \\"state\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"city\\": {\\n      \\"label\\": \\"City\\",\\n      \\"type\\": \\"enum\\",\\n      \\"isNullable\\": false,\\n      \\"dependsOn\\": [\\"state\\", \\"district\\"],\\n      \\"modelName\\": \\"city\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"locality\\": {\\n      \\"label\\": \\"Locality\\",\\n      \\"type\\": \\"enum\\",\\n      \\"isNullable\\": false,\\n      \\"dependsOn\\": [\\"state\\", \\"city\\"],\\n      \\"modelName\\": \\"locality\\"\\n    },\\n    \\"availability\\": {\\n      \\"label\\": \\"Availability\\",\\n      \\"type\\": \\"boolean\\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis configuration informs the table component of:\\n- What columns to display.\\n- The initial order of columns.\\n- Filters to be available to users and the type of value input to be rendered for that filter.\\n\\n### **Benefits of This Approach**\\n\\n#### **1. Easy to Maintain and Scale**\\nNo need to update the frontend codebase every time a column or feature needs to be added or removed\u2014just update the backend configuration.\\n\\n#### **2. Improved User Experience**\\nBy giving users control over how they view and interact with the table, it caters to personalized experiences.\\n\\n#### **3. Faster Development Cycles**\\nDecoupling the table\'s features from the code allows for faster iterations, as the backend can dictate new table features or adjustments.\\n\\n### **Challenges & Considerations**\\n\\n- **API Design**: The backend needs to be designed carefully to ensure the configurations are granular enough for flexibility but not overly complex.\\n- **Syncing State**: Handling user preferences, such as column order or visibility, and syncing them with the backend can be challenging, especially in real-time scenarios.\\n- **Performance**: Fetching large configurations or dealing with very complex tables may introduce performance bottlenecks, which would require optimization.\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\n\\nBuilding a configuration-driven table component has made managing data-rich interfaces easier, more flexible, and more powerful. By leveraging backend configurations, this approach decouples the frontend and backend, allowing for greater scalability, maintainability, and faster iteration times. Whether you\'re building dashboards, reports, or admin panels, this method ensures your tables are not just functional but also adaptive to changing business needs."},{"id":"scalable-mobile-apps-financial-services","metadata":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-42/blog/scalable-mobile-apps-financial-services","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-12-welcome/index.md","title":"Building Scalable Mobile Apps for Financial Services: Key Features and Best Practices","description":"In today\u2019s fast-paced digital world, mobile apps are revolutionizing financial services.
