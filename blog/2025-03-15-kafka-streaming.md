# Kafka Streaming for Live Currency Rates

## Problem Statement

In the fintech world, live currency rate streaming is a critical feature that ensures users receive real-time updates on exchange rates. Our challenge was to build a **continuous live rate streaming system** that updates **every second**

<!-- truncate --> for multiple currency pairs and serves **multiple users concurrently**. Traditional database-driven approaches struggled with performance bottlenecks, latency, and scalability issues, prompting us to explore a more robust solution.

## Why Not a Normal PostgreSQL Database?

While PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database, it was not well-suited for real-time, high-frequency data streaming due to the following reasons:

1. **High Write and Read Latency:** Storing every second’s rate updates would lead to frequent write operations, causing significant latency when querying real-time data.
2. **Scalability Issues:** A large number of concurrent users fetching live rates would overload the database, leading to slow response times.
3. **Polling Inefficiency:** Fetching the latest rates via polling would increase database load and lead to unnecessary resource consumption.
4. **Event-Driven Processing Challenges:** A traditional database does not natively support event-driven architectures, making real-time processing complex.

## Why We Used Kafka?

To address these challenges, we chose **Apache Kafka** as the backbone of our live rate streaming system. Here’s why:

1. **Real-Time Data Streaming:** Kafka’s publish-subscribe model allows us to **continuously push live rates** without querying a database.
2. **High Throughput and Low Latency:** Kafka can handle millions of messages per second with minimal latency, ensuring seamless rate updates.
3. **Scalability:** It supports partitioning, allowing horizontal scaling as the number of users grows.
4. **Fault Tolerance:** Kafka’s distributed architecture ensures data durability and prevents single points of failure.
5. **Decoupling Producers and Consumers:** Currency rate providers (producers) can push data independently of users (consumers), reducing bottlenecks.
6. **Efficient Data Processing:** Kafka integrates well with stream processing frameworks like Apache Flink or Kafka Streams to process and analyze data in real time.

## Implementation Overview

1. **Data Source Integration:** We fetch live currency rates from multiple financial market APIs.
2. **Kafka Producer:** A producer service ingests real-time currency rates into **Kafka topics**.
3. **Kafka Topics & Partitioning:** All currency pair details are received from a single subscribed topic, rather than separate topics for each pair, ensuring centralized data access.
4. **Kafka Consumer:** User applications subscribe to relevant topics to receive **instant rate updates**.
5. **WebSockets for UI Updates:** A WebSocket layer pushes live rate updates to the front end, ensuring a smooth real-time experience.
6. **Monitoring & Alerts:** Kafka’s built-in metrics and third-party tools (Prometheus, Grafana) monitor system performance.

## Additional Considerations

- **Message Retention:** We configured a short retention period since users only need the latest rate.
- **Backpressure Handling:** Implemented a rate limiter to prevent overwhelming consumers.
- **Security & Authentication:** Used Kafka ACLs and SSL encryption to secure data transmission.

## Conclusion

Using Kafka for real-time currency rate streaming enabled us to build a scalable, low-latency, and fault-tolerant system that efficiently handles high-frequency updates for multiple users. This approach significantly outperformed traditional database-driven methods, making Kafka the perfect choice for our use case.
